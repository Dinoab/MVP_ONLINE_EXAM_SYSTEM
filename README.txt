# Intro section
In this Online Examination System project , the system displays all the categories with their respective details and it  allows managing students, teachers, and examination schedules. The system will  contain an admin panel with a student and teacher panel. In general , on  this web examination system , an administrator has full control over the system. He/she can manage users, classes, departments, courses, question sets, and their relations. Here, each and every section has its own respective details such as name and other important details. However, the admin has the right to set a student/teacher’s account. By default, the system automatically sets these users’ login details as their ID.

The system will solve the time that  take to print and copy exam papers,  the time for evaluating the results and  it prevents cheating  between the students on exams. 

This platform doesn't allow   the students to access the question database and cannot take  the administrative rights.
